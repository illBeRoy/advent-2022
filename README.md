# Advent of Code 2022
⚙️ Rust Edition

## About
This is a rust implementation of AoC2022. It will be updated daily (hopefully) with each new task.

## How to Use
> You need to have **rust** and **cargo** installed in order to run this code

Start by running:
```sh
cargo build
```

You can then run the project by running
```sh
cargo run -- --day <DAY> --task <TASK>
```
Where:
- DAY: The day of the puzzle you want to run (2-30)
- TASK: Which task of the given day to run (1-2)

## Q&A
### Why no day 1?
I completed the first day's puzzle in Typescript :)

### How to run with my own input?
Come one, the fun part of AoC is solving the puzzles yourself.
That said, you can find the inputs in `assets/inputs` directory. Simply edit the relevant input file for the day and task you wish to solve.
